# 🧠 LeetCode Learning Journey

Welcome to my `LeetCode` problem-solving journal! This repository documents my progress, mistakes, and solutions as I learn and practice algorithms and data structures.

I use **Obsidian** for note-taking and maintain detailed logs of every problem I solve, including:

- ❌ First incorrect attempts
- ✅ Correct brute-force solutions
- 🚀 Optimized approaches (with time/space complexity)
- 💬 Notes on learning and strategy

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

Each note follows this format:

- **Title**: `### - Problem Title`
  - e.g., `004 - Search Insert Position`
- **Link to the problem**
- **Tags**:
  - `Difficulty`: Easy / Medium / Hard
  - `Topic`: Array, String, Tree, etc.
  - `Techniques`: Binary Search, Two Pointers, etc.
- **Code attempts** (in C#, Python3, and sometimes C++)
  - Includes wrong submissions and step-by-step improvements
  - Final accepted solution with optimal complexity
- **Language Focus**:
  - 💻 C# (primary)
  - 🐍 Python3 (secondary)
  - 💠 Occasional C++

## 🛠 Sample Entry Structure

```
### 004 - Search Insert Position

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/)  
**Tags**: Easy | Array | Binary Search

## First Attempt:
_Wrong answer_

// C# naive implementation
public class Solution {
    public int SearchInsert(int[] nums, int target)
    {
        ...
    }
}

## Second Attempt:
_Correct answer, O(n)_

// C# linear search
public class Solution {
    public int SearchInsert(int[] nums, int target)
    {
        ...
    }
}

## Third Attempt:
_Correct and optimized, O(log n)_

# Python binary search
class Solution:
    def searchInsert(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        ...
```

## ✍️ Why This Format?

- Makes it easy to **track progress** and **reflect** on learning.
- Highlights how **solutions evolve** through iterations.
- Reinforces concepts through **multi-language practice**.
- Helps me **build a consistent problem-solving habit**.

## 🚧 Note

This is a continuous learning project. I add new problems regularly. Stay tuned!
