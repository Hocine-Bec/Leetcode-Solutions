# LeetCode Solutions

This personal repository documents my journey of solving problems on LeetCode. Each problem includes my solution, explanations of what I did, why I chose a particular approach, alternative solutions, and additional notes. I'm using these notes to improve my problem-solving skills, thought process, and understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- **3 Main Folders**: `Easy`, `Medium`, and `Hard`.
  - Each folder contains subfolders for **Data Structures** (e.g., `Arrays`, `Linked Lists`, `Trees`, etc.).
    - Each data structure folder contains problems related to it.
- **Solutions**:
  - Initially solved in **C#**.
  - Later solutions include **Python** and **C++**.
- **Notes**:
  - Problem statement.
  - Approaches.
  - Explanation.
  - Time/Space complexity analysis.
  - Edge cases.
  - Mistakes and debugging.
  - Optimizations.
  - Alternative solutions.
  - Related problems.

## Languages Used
- **C#**: Primary language for initial solutions.
- **Python**: Used for concise and readable implementations.
- **C++**: Used for performance-critical solutions.

## Notes Format
Each problem's notes follow this structure:
1. **Problem Statement**: Brief description of the problem.
2. **Approach**: Explanation of the chosen approach.
3. **Explanation**: Detailed reasoning behind the solution.
4. **Time/Space Complexity**: Analysis of the solution's efficiency.
5. **Edge Cases**: Handling of edge cases.
6. **Mistakes and Debugging**: Common mistakes and how they were resolved.
7. **Optimizations**: Improvements made to the solution.
8. **Alternative Solutions**: Other possible approaches.
9. **Related Problems**: Links to similar problems for further practice.
